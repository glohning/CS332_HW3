# CS 332 HW-3

## Purpose:
Create a search function with the flag -e.

## How to compile:
'gcc hw3.c -g -o hw3'

## How to execute:
'./hw3'

## Notes
Remote debugger started giving me issues and would not let me log in.
Could not figure out how to specify the file/directory, code worked
correctly but would only run exec on the hw3.c file.
