# CS 332 HW-3

## Purpose:
Create a search function with the flag -e.

## How to compile:
'gcc hw3.c -g -o hw3'

## How to execute:
'./hw3'

## Notes
Unsure of why c file saved as cpp instead of c, but still ran on
my end.

Remote debugger started giving me issues and would not let me log in.
Could not figure out how to specify the file/directory, code worked
correctly but would only run exec on the hw3.c file.
